# Air Quality Research Project
This is a research project investigating air quality across 5 US states, collecting and analyzing data from over 1,000 air quality monitoring stations. The project was led by me and my team, and involved advanced spatial analysis using IDW Interpolation, Kriging, Cluster Analysis, Empirical Variograms, and the Skater Algorithms on 2013 US EPA air pollution data to identify significant factors impacting ozone formation.

## Research Goals
The goal of this research project was to identify significant factors impacting ozone formation across 5 US states. To accomplish this, we collected and analyzed data from over 1,000 air quality monitoring stations, and conducted advanced spatial analysis using a variety of techniques.

## Research Findings
Our research findings revealed several significant factors impacting ozone formation, including:

- Emissions from transportation and industrial sources
- High temperatures and sunlight
- Geographic location and topography
- These factors were identified through our advanced spatial analysis techniques, which allowed us to create detailed maps and visualizations of air quality across the 5 US states.

## Getting Started
To access our research findings and data, simply download the repository and explore the files. We have included detailed documentation and analysis of our research methods and findings.
